### 😊 About Me
Hey! I’m Alex, a data scientist and engineer turned ML-for-Health enthusiast.

I like building things that bridge gaps: between research and practice, theory and messy data, or simply an idea and something usable. At heart, I’m driven by curiosity, I keep asking “why” until I reach the bottom, and I enjoy making what I learn public so others can build on it.

- 🎓 Currently: MSc in Machine Learning for Health @ UC3M
- 💡 Previously: Research Assistant @UC3M Telematic Engineering Department & LLM Engineer Intern @Repsol
- 🚀 Interests: AI for medicine and making research useful beyond papers
